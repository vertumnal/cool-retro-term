# cool-cyber-term
## Description
cool-retro-term is a terminal emulator which mimics the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens.
It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.

It uses the QML port of qtermwidget (Konsole): https://github.com/Swordfish90/qmltermwidget.

This terminal emulator works under Linux and macOS and requires Qt5. It's suggested that you stick to the latest LTS version.

Settings such as colors, fonts, and effects can be accessed via context menu.
